# Gardener GDC CI & Release Pipeline (`gardener-gdc-ci`)

[![Release Pipeline](https://github.com/gardener/gardener-gdc-ci/actions/workflows/release-pipeline.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gardener/gardener-gdc-ci/actions/workflows/release-pipeline.yaml)
[![CI](https://github.com/gardener/gardener-gdc-ci/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gardener/gardener-gdc-ci/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)

## Goal

`gardener-gdc-ci` is the end-to-end qualification and release certification pipeline for Gardener on Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) air-gapped. Its goal is to ensure that all GDC Gardener provider components work together as a verified stack before promoting container images and Helm charts to the Gardener artifact registry and cutting official SemVer releases.

## What It Does

The pipeline qualifies the following source repositories together in a live GDC Staging environment:

- [`gardener/gardener-extension-provider-gdc`](https://github.com/gardener/gardener-extension-provider-gdc)
- [`gardener/machine-controller-manager-provider-gdc`](https://github.com/gardener/machine-controller-manager-provider-gdc)
- [`GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-provider-gdc`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-provider-gdc)
- [`gardener/external-dns-management`](https://github.com/gardener/external-dns-management)

Each pipeline run executes the following end-to-end qualification flow:

1. **Build Candidate Artifacts**: Builds container images and OCI Helm charts from the target Git refs of each component repository.
2. **Deploy Gardener Control Plane & Seed**: Deploys a Virtual Garden control plane and registers a GDC Seed cluster (`gardenlet`).
3. **Provision & Validate Tenant Shoot Cluster**: Provisions a tenant Shoot cluster on GDC and executes functional test suites (worker scaling, persistent storage, pod/node networking, load balancers, DNS lifecycle, and etcd backup/restore) followed by the CNCF Kubernetes Conformance suite (`sonobuoy`).
4. **Teardown Environment**: Cleans up all Shoot, Seed, and Virtual Garden test resources (capturing diagnostic snapshots automatically if any stage fails).
5. **Publish Certified Artifacts & Tag Releases**: Promotes verified images and Helm charts to the Gardener registry (`snapshots` or `releases`) and, on official release runs, creates the Git release tags and bumps component `VERSION` files to the next `-dev` version.
6. **Build and Publish an OCM Component Descriptor**: Publishes a descriptor for the certified GDC bundle, including its OCI images, Helm charts, tested source commits, and certification labels.

## How to Trigger the Pipeline

The **[Gardener GDC Release Pipeline](https://github.com/gardener/gardener-gdc-ci/actions/workflows/release-pipeline.yaml)** runs automatically on a schedule and can also be triggered on demand by approved Google and SAP maintainers listed in [`OWNERS_ALIASES`](OWNERS_ALIASES) / [`CODEOWNERS`](CODEOWNERS).

### 1. Automated Schedules
- **Nightly Snapshot (`snapshot` mode)**: Runs automatically every weeknight (**Monday–Friday at `02:00 PST` / `10:00 UTC`**) against the default branches of all component repositories, and automatically skips Tuesday's snapshot on biweekly release weeks.
- **Biweekly Official Release (`release` mode)**: Runs automatically **once every two weeks on Tuesday at `21:00 PST` (`9:00 PM PST` / Wednesday `05:00 UTC`)** with `next_version=bump-patch`, leaving a ~4–5 hour gap before the next snapshot run to avoid cluster pool collisions.

### 2. Pull Request Comment (`/test-release`)
To run the full E2E pipeline against an open Pull Request in `gardener/gardener-gdc-ci`, comment on the PR:
```text
/test-release
```

### 3. GitHub Actions UI (`workflow_dispatch`)
Navigate to **[Actions → Gardener GDC Release Pipeline](https://github.com/gardener/gardener-gdc-ci/actions/workflows/release-pipeline.yaml)**, click **Run workflow**, and configure the desired inputs:

| Input | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `release_mode` | `snapshot` | Execution mode: `snapshot` (nightly/pre-release) or `release` (official SemVer release) |
| `next_version` | `bump-patch` | Next `-dev` version bump after a successful official release (`bump-patch`, `bump-minor`, `bump-major`, or `noop`) |
| `pr_number` | `""` | Optional Pull Request number in `gardener-gdc-ci` to test |
| `extension_gdc_ref` | `main` | Git ref (branch, tag, or SHA) for `gardener/gardener-extension-provider-gdc` |
| `mcm_provider_gdc_ref` | `main` | Git ref (branch, tag, or SHA) for `gardener/machine-controller-manager-provider-gdc` |
| `external_dns_ref` | `master` | Git ref (branch, tag, or SHA) for `gardener/external-dns-management` |
| `cloud_provider_gdc_ref` | `main` | Git ref (branch, tag, or SHA) for `GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-provider-gdc` |
| `skip_conformance` | `false` | Skip the Sonobuoy CNCF conformance suite for faster validation runs |
| `publish_to_public_registry` | `true` | Publish certified artifacts to the Gardener registry on success |

### 4. GitHub CLI (`gh`)
```bash
# Trigger a snapshot qualification run
gh workflow run release-pipeline.yaml \
  --repo gardener/gardener-gdc-ci \
  --ref main \
  -f release_mode=snapshot

# Trigger an official SemVer release and bump patch version to next -dev
gh workflow run release-pipeline.yaml \
  --repo gardener/gardener-gdc-ci \
  --ref main \
  -f release_mode=release \
  -f next_version=bump-patch

# Trigger a run for a specific Pull Request
gh workflow run release-pipeline.yaml \
  --repo gardener/gardener-gdc-ci \
  --ref main \
  -f pr_number=<PR_NUMBER>
```

## Monitoring & Release Dashboard

- **Release Pipeline Dashboard ([`https://gardener.github.io/gardener-gdc-ci/`](https://gardener.github.io/gardener-gdc-ci/))**: Displays pass rates, latest certified versions, stage-by-stage status badges, component commit SHAs, and historical run results.
- **GitHub Actions Job Summary**: Every workflow run publishes a summary table under the run's **Summary** tab with stage outcomes, component SHAs, artifact versions, and target registries.
- **Local Release Pipeline CLI ([`release-pipeline/README.md`](./release-pipeline/README.md))**: Provides `./release-pipeline/cli.sh` for inspecting active release test jobs and cluster pool availability, refreshing kubeconfigs into `/tmp/kubeconfigs/`, and manually tearing down active test environments.

## Produced Artifacts & Versioning

Artifact versions are derived from the root `VERSION` file in each component repository (`v0.5.3-dev` in the GDC repositories; `v0.53.0-dev` in `external-dns-management`):

- **`snapshot` Mode (Nightly / PR / Pre-Release):**
  - Uses `<VERSION>-<short_sha>` (for example, `v0.5.3-dev-8e432a2`, and `0.5.3-dev-8e432a2` with the leading `v` stripped for Helm charts).
  - Publishes to **`europe-docker.pkg.dev/gardener-project/snapshots/gardener/gardener-gdc-ci`**.
- **`release` Mode (Official Release):**
  - Strips `-dev` from `VERSION` (for example, `v0.5.3`, and `0.5.3` for Helm charts) for GDC repositories that have code changes since their last published release tag.
  - Publishes to **`europe-docker.pkg.dev/gardener-project/releases/gardener/gardener-gdc-ci`**, creates the corresponding Git release tag and GitHub Release on changed GDC repositories, and bumps their `VERSION` file according to `next_version`.

### OCM Component Descriptor & Security Attestations

After successful public promotion, the pipeline publishes the certified extension as the OCM component `github.com/gardener/gardener-extension-provider-gdc:<release-version>`:

- **Base Definition & Source Commits**: The tested extension checkout must contain `.ocm/base-component.yaml`, which supplies the base component metadata. The published descriptor records the tested extension, MCM, and CCM source commits.
- **Component Resources & Image Vector**:
  - The provider and admission container images and Helm charts are included as local OCM resources.
  - MCM and CCM metadata (`sourceRepository`, labels, and `targetVersion`) is derived from `imagevector/images.yaml` in the tested extension checkout, with image references and versions replaced by the certified artifacts.
  - CSI images are excluded because their registries are currently inaccessible.
  - The `external-dns` artifact is used during certification testing but is not part of the extension component vector.
- **SAST (`gosec`) Verification**: On official extension releases, `gosec` runs as a blocking gate before the extension release images are built, and its report is attached to the component descriptor. The main-source SAST skip label is included only when that report is attached, even if the extension's base definition declares it unconditionally.
- **Retention & Immutability**: Official release descriptors are preserved on subsequent no-change runs. Newly generated descriptors are also uploaded as the `gdc-component-descriptor` workflow artifact.
